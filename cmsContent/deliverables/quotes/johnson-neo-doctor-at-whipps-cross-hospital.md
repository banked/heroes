title: 'Johnson Neo, Doctor at Whipps Cross Hospital'
quote: >-
  I cannot thank HEROES and their volunteers enough for their charitable act.
  Big special shout out to Rebecca from William White Meats who has been so kind
  and helpful.

  COVID-19 has changed the whole dynamic of the workplace in hospital - many of
  my colleagues were ill or having to self-isolate themselves. After long
  working hours we were faced with the horror of not being able to get fresh
  goods from the supermarket.

  Through this initiative I have had fresh chicken breast and some fruits sent
  to my doorstep - that is one less thing to worry about and a few more hours of
  rest for myself. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.
