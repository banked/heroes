  A massive thank you to William White Meats for my HEROES food box delivery. We
  received a lovely selection of meat (vacuum packed and frozen in portion
  sizes), bags of frozen veg, strawberries and pitta bread.

  I'll be starting at The Nightingale (Excel Centre) tomorrow, and it's so
  reassuring my family I'm leaving behind a well stocked freezer.

  We are so grateful!
