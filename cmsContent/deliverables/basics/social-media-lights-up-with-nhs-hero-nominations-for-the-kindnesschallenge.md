We've partnered with Selfridges department store for their weekly #KindnessChallenge to give someone the chance to win a hamper full of pampering products for an NHS hero in their local community. Entries are made by nominating their hero on Instagram, telling us why they deserve to win â€“ we've already received lots of special mentions.
