In light of lockdown in London, the Noxy Brothers were forced to close all of their coffee bars across the city. But when they found out NHS workers at Northwick Park Hospital were going without their coffee because the local shops had closed too, the boys transported their Burlington Arcade bar to the hospital so they could serve free coffee to all NHS staff for the foreseeable future. Running on donated coffee from Ozone Coffee and volunteer baristas, they're bringing a moment of comfort to those working to get us through the crisis. And they've raised more than Â£15,000 for HEROES as well.
