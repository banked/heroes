It was happy faces all round when frontline staff at Royal Brompton Hospital received 300 delicious hot meals, cooked and dropped by the Chilli Bees Catering team. In fact, the delivery was so well received, we immediately started an on-going partnership with Chilli Bees to ensure lots more drops like this could be made.
