We've partnered with Maddox Gallery to launch Art for HEROES. Thirty fantastic artists have donated their work to support NHS frontline staff, with all proceeds from every piece sold going to HEROES. Buyers were quick – this beautiful piece sold in just a matter of hours!

Jay Rutland, Creative Director of Maddox Gallery and ambassador for Heroes says: “We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all of the health professionals who are on the front lines fighting COVID-19. The Maddox family of artists, employees, and clients have joined the rest of UK in doing all that has been asked of us - to stay home while so many NHS staff expose themselves to a global crisis that has captured the world’s attention.

Our doctors and nurses need our support now more than ever before, and we couldn’t be more proud to work with over twenty artists as we launch the 'Art For Heroes' campaign, supporting the charity organisation HEROES."
