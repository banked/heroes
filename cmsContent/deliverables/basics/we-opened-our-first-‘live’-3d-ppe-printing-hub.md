As supplies of life-saving PPE run critically low, we needed a way to make it ourselves. Uniting with fellow industry leaders under the name SHIELD, we opened a 3D printing facility funded by Heroes developing new designs for sustainable masks and visors, in addition to other critical PPE, on a mass scale. We’ve called on designers, printers, suppliers and donors across the UK to join our effort and help get equipment into the helping hands that really need it.
