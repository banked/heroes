We’re dedicated to doing anything which makes an NHS worker's life better. In this case, we teamed up with London department store Selfridges, premium car service Addison Lee and Contractorsappeal.com to deliver 1,600 Easter eggs to hospitals, GP’s and hospices across the UK so they could enjoy a well earned treat.
