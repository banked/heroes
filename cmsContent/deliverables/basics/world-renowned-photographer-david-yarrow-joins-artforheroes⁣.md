In it's first week, our #ArtForCampaigns campaign increased donations to over £750,000. Now we're happy to announce that world-renowned British Photographer, David Yarrow, has generously donated a full print edition of his latest image, ‘Our Pride’. ⁣He describes the lioness as an embodiment of the brave spirit required by every NHS worker, volunteer and patient experiencing this global disaster. Visit www.artforheroes.co.uk to donate and you'll receive your own digital print, or donate from £500 to purchase an unbranded fine art print of 'Our Pride'.⁣⁣ For every physical print purchased, another will be gifted to an NHS worker as thanks for their valued work!
