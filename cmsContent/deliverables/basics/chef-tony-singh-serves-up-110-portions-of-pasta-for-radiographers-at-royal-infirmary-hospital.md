> "Thank you to all the heroes who helped organise food for all the radiographers at RIE and to Tony Singh for cooking it all for us. We were absolutely blown away by everyone’s generosity and thinking of us during this pandemic. We had so much we shared it out to all our colleagues working with us in the Emergency Department and ITU."
