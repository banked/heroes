HEROES: Help Them Help Us and the British Medical Association (BMA) have announced a new partnership to protect the physical and mental wellbeing of doctors on the frontline during the Covid-19 pandemic.

HEROES was founded and is staffed by our frontline NHS workers and their families, and powered by a network of generous corporations, service providers, and individuals devoted to making help easy to find, and easy to provide. The band of volunteers behind HEROES – from a range of industries – is working around the clock to build a permanent platform that will link donors, providers and our NHS staff to one another in this urgent time of need:

* **by facilitating the delivery of food via existing delivery infrastructure** (restaurants, commercial kitchens and food service businesses)
* **by obtaining PPE** (certified personal protective equipment) including masks, gloves, gowns, and protective eyewear and working closely with Government and the NHSE to ensure targeted delivery
* **by providing vital human health and well-being services**, such as accredited counselling, emergency childcare, and transport and food drops where needed

The BMA, the doctors’ trade union, recently launched an online fundraising page, BMA Giving, which will combine efforts with HEROES to fund tangible benefits for doctors and medical students working to tackle Covid-19.

Through this new collaboration, donations from the public will be disbursed across charities whose aim is to support doctors on the frontline so that they can focus on providing vital treatment for patients.

Dr David Wrigley, Deputy Chair of the BMA Council, said: “The BMA is delighted to be working with HEROES to help support doctors on the frontline during what will be an extremely difficult time for the NHS.

“Doctors will be tested to their limits over the coming weeks and months as the NHS faces unprecedented pressures and it is absolutely vital that their physical and mental wellbeing is supported.

This new collaboration will help to direct these generous donations to doctor and medical student focused charities where they will benefit colleagues the most. This in turn helps the BMA to look after doctors and medical students so that they can continue to look after their patients.”

Dr Dominic Pimenta, CEO and founder of HEROES added: "We are proud to work with the British Medical Association to support NHS frontline doctors and medical students as part of our wider commitment to all NHS staff.

“We will work with BMA Giving to get funds to frontline staff and are privileged to welcome their experience on our advisory committee."
